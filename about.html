										<h2>Introduction</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We provide creative and innovative students at St Helena School extraordinary and exciting experiences and opportunities through the means of constructing robots and competing in numerous tournaments. Currently, we primarily offer both VEX IQ & VEX EDR robotics platforms to most students as well as Lego Mindstorms as an alternative to others. Participants win not only on the game field, but also off the field, where they'll find themselves developing core teamwork and communication skills that will prove to be especially beneficial in later life. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths) didn't always have to be boring!</p>
